Chucklefish doesn't like bat files, BUT txt files are fine.

To turn the ADVANCED_RACE_TEMPLATE_EASY_SETUP.txt into a bat file open it up in your word editor, go Save As, then Save As Type, change that to All Files. Then change the name to BASIC_RACE_TEMPLATE_EASY_SETUP.bat

Tada!

Now double click to run it.
